## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-02

Initial release.

### Added

- The godplans Agent Skill: one command that runs discovery, forces every
  hard-to-reverse decision, and emits a complete, agent-executable master
  plan at `.godplans/PLAN.mdx` before any code is written.
- 18 domain reference modules descending from aihxp arc-ready and
  ready-suite (product, architecture, roadmap, stack, repo, build, deploy,
  observe, launch), the seven aihxp auditors inverted into plan-time
  requirements (security from secauditor and harden-ready, code-quality
  from codeauditor, database from dbauditor, llm from llmauditor, seo from
  seoauditor, ui from uiauditor, ux from uxauditor), aihxp/pillars
  (agent-memory), and aihxp/codedna (style-genome).
- Four core modules: plan-format (the PLAN.mdx contract), discovery
  (intake, archetype, applicability matrix, interview), compliance
  (Anthropic Usage Policy gate and account safety), exemplar (the quality
  bar, worked).
- PLAN.mdx template with GFM-safe MDX body, GP-numbered checkbox tasks,
  waves, must-haves, executor rules, and a session log.
- Cross-tool packaging: canonical skill under `skills/godplans/`,
  `.agents/skills` and `.claude/skills` projections, `install.sh` with a
  six-destination matrix, generated `PROMPT.md` fallback for T3 Chat,
  Aider, and plain chat surfaces.
- Meta-linter (`scripts/lint.sh`) enforcing unicode cleanliness, version
  parity, spec-bound description length, module contract completeness,
  and PROMPT.md freshness; wired into CI with an installer smoke test.
